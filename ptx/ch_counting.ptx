      One of the first things you learn in mathematics is how to count.
      Now we want to count large collections of things quickly and precisely.
      For example:

      <ul permid="ch_counting-intr-ul">
        <li permid="ch_counting-intr-ul-l_j">
          <p permid="ch_counting-intr-ul-l_j-p">
            In a group of 10 people,
            if everyone shakes hands with everyone else exactly once,
            how many handshakes took place?
          </p>
        </li>

        <li permid="ch_counting-intr-ul-l_s">
          <p permid="ch_counting-intr-ul-l_s-p">
            How many ways can you distribute <m>10</m> girl scout cookies to <m>7</m> boy scouts?
          </p>
        </li>

        <li permid="ch_counting-intr-ul-l_b">
          <p permid="ch_counting-intr-ul-l_b-p">
            How many anagrams are there of <q>anagram</q>?
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

      Before tackling questions like these,
      let's look at the basics of counting.
