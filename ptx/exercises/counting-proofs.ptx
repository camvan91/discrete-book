          Question: How many subsets of size <m>k</m> are there of the set <m>\{1,2,\ldots, n\}</m>?
        </p>

        <p permid="exers_comb-proofs-e_xo-s-p2">
          Answer 1: You must choose <m>k</m> out of <m>n</m> elements to put in the set,
          which can be done in <m>{n \choose k}</m> ways.
        </p>

        <p permid="exers_comb-proofs-e_xo-s-p3">
          Answer 2: First count the number of <m>k</m>-element subsets of
          <m>\{1,2,\ldots,
          n\}</m> which contain the number <m>n</m>.
          We must choose <m>k-1</m> of the <m>n-1</m> other element to include in this set.
          Thus there are <m>{n-1\choose k-1}</m> such subsets.
          We have not yet counted all the <m>k</m>-element subsets of <m>\{1,2,\ldots,
          n\}</m> though.
          In fact, we have missed exactly those subsets which do NOT contain <m>n</m>.
          To form one of these subsets,
          we need to choose <m>k</m> of the other <m>n-1</m> elements,
          so this can be done in <m>{n-1 \choose k}</m> ways.
          Thus the answer to the question is <m>{n-1 \choose k-1} + {n-1 \choose k}</m>.

        <p permid="exers_comb-proofs-e_xo-s-p4">

        </p>

        <p permid="exers_comb-proofs-e_dp-s-p2">
          Answer 1: We must choose 2 elements from <m>n+1</m> choices,
          so there are <m>{n+1 \choose 2}</m> subsets.
        </p>

        <p permid="exers_comb-proofs-e_dp-s-p3">
          Answer 2: We break this question down into cases,
          based on what the larger of the two elements in the subset is.
          The larger element can't be 1, since we need at least one element smaller than it.
        </p>

        <p permid="exers_comb-proofs-e_dp-s-p4">
          Larger element is 2: there is 1 choice for the smaller element.
        </p>

        <p permid="exers_comb-proofs-e_dp-s-p5">
          Larger element is 3: there are 2 choices for the smaller element.

          Larger element is 4: there are 3 choices for the smaller element.

        <p permid="exers_comb-proofs-e_dp-s-p7">
          And so on.
          When the larger element is <m>n+1</m>,
          there are <m>n</m> choices for the smaller element.
          Since each two element subset must be in exactly one of these cases,
          the total number of two element subsets is <m>1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n</m>.
        </p>

        <p permid="exers_comb-proofs-e_dp-s-p8">
          Answer 1 and answer 2 are both correct answers to the same question,
          so they must be equal.

              We answer the question of how many length <m>n</m> ternary digit strings there are in two ways.
              First, each digit can be one of three choices,
              so the total number of strings is <m>3^n</m>.
              On the other hand,
              we could break the question down into cases by how many of the digits are 2's.
              If they are all 2's, then there are <m>{n \choose 0}</m> strings.
              If all but one is a 2, then there are <m>2{n \choose 1}</m> strings.
              If all but 2 of the digits are 2's, then there are <m>2^2{n \choose 2}</m> strings.
              We choose 2 of the <m>n</m> digits to be non-2, and then there are 2 choices for each of those digits.
              And so on for every possible number of 2's in the string.
              Therefore <m> {n \choose 0} + 2{n \choose 1} + 2^2{n \choose 2} + 2^3{n \choose 3} + \cdots + 2^n{n \choose n} = 3^n</m>.
