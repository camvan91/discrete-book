              You need 10 coins.
              You could have 3 pennies, 3 nickels, and 3 dimes.
              The 10th coin must either be a quarter,
              giving you 4 coins that are all different,
              or else a 4th penny, nickel or dime.
              To prove this,
              assume you don't have 4 coins that are all the same or all different.
              In particular, this says that you only have 3 coin types,
              and each of those types can only contain 3 coins,
              for a total of 9 coins, which is less than 10.

        Are there any trolls that are not scared of goats?
        Recall, of course, that all trolls are either knights
        (who always tell the truth)
        or knaves
        (who always lie).
