        A

        is a collection of objects,
        just like a set, but can contain an object more than once
        (the order of the elements still doesn't matter).
        For example,
        <m>\{1,1, 2, 5, 5, 7\}</m>
        is a multiset of size 6.

              This is backwards.
              We don't want the stars to represent the kids because the kids are not identical,
              but the stars are.
              Instead we should use 5 stars
              (for the lollipops)
              and use 5 bars to switch between the 6 kids.
              For example,

              Each star should represent one of the 6 units that add up to 6, and the bars should
