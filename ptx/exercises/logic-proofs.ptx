    <statement>
      <p permid="khz">
        Your <q>friend</q> has shown you a <q>proof</q>
        he wrote to show that <m>1 = 3</m>.
        Here is the proof:
      </p>

      <proof permid="Ehu">
        <p permid="fxG">
          I claim that <m>1 = 3</m>.
          Of course we can do anything to one side of an equation as long as we also do it to the other side.
          So subtract 2 from both sides.
          This gives <m>-1 = 1</m>.
          Now square both sides, to get <m>1 = 1</m>.
          And we all agree this is true.
        </p>
      </proof>

      <p permid="QoI">
        What is going on here?
        Is your friend's argument valid?
        Is the argument a proof of the claim <m>1=3</m>?
        Carefully explain using what we know about logic.
        Hint: What implication follows from the given proof?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution permid="Yal">
      <p permid="gCZ">
        In the proof we assume that <m>1=3</m> and conclude that <m>1=1</m>.
        So we have proved the implication
        <me permid="jcg">
          1=3 \imp 1=1
        </me>
      </p>

      <p permid="MKi">
        Note that we actually have a valid proof of this,
        and that the implication is true
        (for one thing, the <q>if</q> part is true,
        so the implication is automatically true).
        However, what we really want is to converse of this, that <m>1=1 \imp 1=3</m>.
        But as we know,
        the converse is not implied by the original implication
        (it better not be,
        otherwise we could conclude that 1 actually was 3).
      </p>

      <p permid="sRr">
        Another way to say this:
        we can never conclude anything about the
        <q>if</q> part of an implication,
        since the <q>if</q> part can be true or false even if the implication is true.
